# Neurocampus course 2026

This repository contains scripts and practical materials for the course "The Whole-Brain Signals" (2026). 

This is an introductory course. It is designed for students who are encountering EEG and MEG analysis for the first time. The goal is to build intuition, conceptual clarity, and hands-on familiarity with real electrophysiological data. The course does not assume advanced mathematical background, deep signal processing expertise, or prior experience with neuroimaging toolboxes. 

Lesson 1 notebook (`1. First look at MEG and EEG.ipynb`) introduces signal fundamentals for EEG/MEG: time series concepts, continuous vs discrete and analog vs digital signals, sampling and aliasing (Nyquist intuition), quantization, and basic discrete-time building blocks. It then transitions to practical MNE basics: data structure, montage/reference concepts, and a first look at events/annotations.
